# Google Maps for Flutter (Unofficial Fixed

This is not my plugin,
You can check the official plugin here
https://github.com/flutter/plugins/tree/master/packages/google_maps_flutter

I create this repo for fix the gestureREcognizers issue.
I delete this 
  final Set<Factory<OneSequenceGestureRecognizer>> gestureRecognizers;
and all related variable at google_map.dart

Btw, still learning how to use GitHub.
I will be happy if you have a suggestion about how to  use GitHub correctly.
Thx
